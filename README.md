VERY ROUGH CODE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT USE. SOME ASSIGNMENTS MADE IN SUCH AN AGONY THAT I MADE THEM IMPOSSIBLE TO UDNERSTAND. LOOKT AT YOUR OWN RISK. IN HOPLESS ATTEMPT TO BE QUIK I EVEN RESUED CODE FROM PART 1 DIRECTLY IN CLASS PART1 TO SOLVE PART2. THAT MEANS FOR SOME ASSIGNMENTS PART 1 IS NOT CORRECT.
